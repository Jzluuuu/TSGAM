\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer, the number of samples.}

\item{blocks}{List, including integers, the numbers of different variables.}

\item{p_pattern_relevant}{List, including integers, the numbers of different
variables affected by different pattern effects.}

\item{p_diff_relevant}{List, including integers, the numbers of different
variables affected by different expressed effects.}

\item{n_shared_factors}{Integer. Number of shared factors across omics
blocks. Larger values introduce stronger shared structure between
different omics layers. Set to \eqn{0} to disable shared effects.}

\item{shared_factor_sd}{Numeric. Standard deviation of the shared factors.
Controls the overall strength of the shared signal across omics blocks.}

\item{loading_sd}{Numeric. Standard deviation of the loadings linking shared
factors to individual features. Larger values increase feature-level
variation induced by shared factors.}

\item{mean.pat}{Numeric, the mean of different pattern effect coefficients
for all related variables.}

\item{sd.pat}{Numeric, the variability (standard deviation) of different
pattern effect coefficients for all related variables.}

\item{mean.diff}{Numeric, the mean of different expressed effect coefficients
for all related variables}

\item{sd.diff}{Numeric, the variability (standard deviation) of different
expressed effect coefficients for all related variables.}

\item{mean.bg}{Numeric, the mean of background noise.}

\item{sd.bg}{Numeric, the variability (standard deviation) of
background noise.}

\item{percentage_overlap_variables}{Numeric, in the range of \eqn{0}
to \eqn{1}, the percentage of variables with both confounder and treatment
effects given fixed number of variables with each effect.}

\item{seeds}{Integer. Default value is randomly selected from
\eqn{0} to \eqn{999}.}
}
\value{
\code{simData} returns a list that contains the following components:

\item{data}{The simulated data.}
\item{Age}{The simulated outcome variable indicating the Age information.}
\item{Group}{The simulated outcome variable indicating the Age group
information.}
\item{true.pat}{The variables assigned with the different pattern effect.}
\item{true.diff}{The variables assigned with the different expressed effect.}
}
\description{
This function simulates data with margin- and nonlinear-dependent age effects
from Gaussian distribution for multi-omics data.
